                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>
                        You hail from the Lakelands, once a remote colony of the Batrian Khanate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Batrians would use convicted criminals to trap Lakelander gods. Once a god has taken root in its new hosts, the criminals would be executed, bringing an end to the resident spirit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You were one such host. A nameless nature spirit shared your body and that of your companions. It lent you its power.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Days before your execution, the governor of Lakelands received a missive from the Hundred-Blood Empress: every one of her soldiers were to return to the Batrian capital.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The soldiers left. The governor fled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A fellow Lakelander freed you from captivity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your people proclaimed the land a republic and began the delicate process of decolonisation. Your condition as a host to one of the land's gods helped you secure an official position with the new state.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rebuild your homeland, Lakelander. Protect it from its enemies—the sentient darkness of the forest, the schemers who would welcome a return to Batrian rule, the evil that consumes the Khanate and will soon turn its baleful eye to the Lakelands.
                    </p>

                            A player character in I Bury the Gods has four modifiers:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="emphasis">Agility</span></li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Each modifier represents a permanent aspect of the character.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span class="emphasis">Agility</span> represents the player character's reflexes, balance and coordination.

                            <span class="emphasis">Insight</span> represents memory, judgment and intuition.

                            <span class="emphasis">Strength</span> represents energy, physical power and toughness.

                            <span class="emphasis">Will</span> represents courage, discipline and perseverance.

                            Skills represent your character's knowledge and expertise.

                        <p>
                            A skill allows you to reduce the target score of an action by its skill score.

                        <p>
                            At any time, if your character has one or more experience points, you may choose to spend those experience points to improve the character's skills.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To increase a skill, you must spend as many experience points as the skill score after the increase. For example, if you want to increase a skill to a score of 3, you will have to spend three experience points.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You must pay the experience points for each 1 point increase. For example, to increase a skill score from 0 to 2, you will have to spend three experience points — one experience point to increase the skill score to 1 plus two to increase it to 2.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You cannot increase a skill score above 4.

                            To play I Bury the Gods, you will need a player character. Follow these steps to create your player character:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Allocate your character's modifiers</li>
                            <li>Choose your character's skills</li>
                            <li>Make your focus pool</li>
                            <li>Choose a name for your character</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h2>Modifiers</h2>
                        <p>
                            Allocate the following scores to you player character's modifiers:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>2</li>
                            <li>1</li>
                            <li>1</li>
                            <li>0</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            You must allocate all four scores. Each score can be allocated to one modifier only.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2>Skills</h2>
                        <p>
                            Next, allocate five experience points to your character's skills. Your character sheet has a section for you to track your character's skill.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2>Focus pool</h2>
                        <p>
                            Put four tokens in a pile to form the focus pool.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Finally, give your character a name.

                            If your character attempts to do something with an uncertain outcome, the result will be determined by performing an "action".

                        <p>
                            Your character may attempt the following actions:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="emphasis">Take a risk</span></li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            If your character is fighting another, you will also be able to attempt the following actions:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="emphasis">Strike down</span></li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            An action requires you to roll two dice and compare the results to a target score.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A die result that matches or exceeds the target score is called a winner. A die result lower than the target score is called a dud.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A score of 10 is always a winner.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A score of 1 is always a dud.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The target score represents the difficulty of the task. It is up to you to determine the appropriate target score for an action.

                            Your modifiers reduce the target score, making it easier for you to accomplish certain actions. After determining the appropriate target score for an action, subtract the relevant modifier from the score.

                            If you have a skill relevant to the action, you may choose to spend a focus token to reduce the target score by the skill score. For example, if you attempt to climb a cliff and you have a climber skill score of 3, you may spend a focus token to reduce the target score by 3.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To spend a focus token, take a token from your focus pool and place it aside. It is now spent. You cannot spend a spent token.
